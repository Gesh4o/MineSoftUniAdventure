Homework contains two parts:
1."10.ProjectSolution" you can find VS 2015 solution which
contains projects - "SolarSystem" here is slightly refactored
project from the given homework. "Slightly" because has optimized
performance not from HQC point of view. Other projects contain source 
code for testing operations(like "+") and alogortihms. Feel free 
to see them in order to see if the test I have made are relevant.
02."CleanTheSmellyCode" which contains more info about the first
task from the homework.
-"ComparingSortingAlgorthms" and "ComparingDataStructures" 
show table of summarized data. Also in every test project you 
can look at "..\bin\Debug\" directory for additional info.
