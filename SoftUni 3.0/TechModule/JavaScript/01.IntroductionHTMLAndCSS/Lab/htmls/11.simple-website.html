        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.It is the fifth and
        current version
        of the HTML standard.
    </p>
    <p> It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) to improve the language with support
        for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humansâ€”and consistently understood by computers
        and devices such
        as web browsers, parsers, etc.HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
        HTML.
    </p>
    <p> HTML5 includes
        detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations;it extends, improves and rationalizes
        the markup
        available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web
        applications.For the
        same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features
        designed with
        low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
