                    ScienceDaily reported in 2012 that drinking coffee may help people with Parkinson’s disease control their movement. Ronald
                    Postuma, MD, the study author, said, "Studies have shown that people who use caffeine are less likely
                    to develop Parkinson’s disease, but this is one of the first studies in humans to show that caffeine
                    can help with movement symptoms for people who already have the disease."

                    A study done by the National Institute of Health found that those who drink four or more cups of coffee were about 10 percent
                    less likely to be depressed than those who had never touched the java. And apparently it’s not because
                    of the "caffeine high" — Coke can also give you a caffeine high, but it’s linked to depression. Study
                    author, Honglei Chen, MD, PhD, told Prevention.com that the proposed reason coffee makes you feel good
                    is because of those trusty antioxidants.

                    The New York Times reports, "Scientists and many athletes have known for years, of course, that a cup of coffee before a
                    workout jolts athletic performance, especially in endurance sports like distance running and cycling."
                    Caffeine increases the number of fatty acids in the bloodstream, which allows athletes’ muscles to absorb
                    and burn those fats for fuel, therefore saving the body’s small reserves of carbohydrates for later on
                    in the exercise.
